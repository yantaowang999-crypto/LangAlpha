"""Workspace Manager: the project-facing façade over ``ComputerManager``.

A workspace is a project; the machine it runs on is a computer. Everything
keyed by machine -- the session cache, the locks, the sandbox lifecycle --
lives in ``ComputerManager``; what is left here is the project-shaped API the
routes and the agent call, plus the two operations that are genuinely about a
project rather than a machine: creating one and deleting one.

        CancelledError revert, or a publish that never lands), the row stays
        'starting' with no other recovery path — every later caller waits out
        start_wait_timeout then raises, and /start rejects non-'stopped'.

        Never reaps a start THIS process is still running: an in-flight lazy
        owner holds the record's ``pending_lazy_sync`` flag and will promote (on

        that membership and silently no-op the owner's promotion, stranding a

        That guard makes the in-process case correct regardless of how slow the

        default) then only governs the cross-process backstop — rows wedged by a
        crashed/recycled worker, which carry no local membership.

        The revert enters through the computer, so every project on the machine
        follows it back to 'stopped' in the same statement. A 'creating' row is
        claimed by its own create request within moments, so one that has sat
